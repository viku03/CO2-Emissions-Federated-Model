# CO2-Emissions-Federated-Model
 Implementing a federated learning model using PySyft and XGBoost to collaboratively train on CO2 emissions data while preserving data privacy. This project includes training on both synthetic and real-world datasets, aiming to optimize environmental processes and reduce carbon footprints through decentralized, privacy-preserving AI.
